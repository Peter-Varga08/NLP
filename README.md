# Comparing Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches to Identify Post-Editors from Logging and Linguistics Features: an Investigative Stylometry Study

## Description
This repository contains the code used for the report *Comparing Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches to Identify Post-Editors from Logging and Linguistics Features: an Investigative Stylometry Study*. This report was written for the final project of the course *Natural Language Processing* at the University of Groningen.

[Maybe something about the different models and how we divided these in several folders]
